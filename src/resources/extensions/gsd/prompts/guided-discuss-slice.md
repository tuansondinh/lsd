You are interviewing the user to surface behavioural, UX, and usage grey areas for slice **{{sliceId}}: {{sliceTitle}}** of milestone **{{milestoneId}}**.

Your goal is **not** to settle tech stack, naming conventions, or architecture — that happens during research and planning. Your goal is to produce a context file that captures the human decisions: what this slice should feel like, how it should behave, what edge cases matter, where scope begins and ends, and what the user cares about that won't be obvious from the roadmap entry alone.

## Interview Protocol

### Before your first question round

Do a lightweight targeted investigation so your questions are grounded in reality:
- Scout the codebase (`rg`, `find`, or `scout` for broad unfamiliar areas) to understand what already exists that this slice touches or builds on
- Check the roadmap context above to understand what surrounds this slice — what comes before, what depends on it
- Identify the 3–5 biggest behavioural unknowns: things where the user's answer will materially change what gets built

Do **not** go deep — just enough that your questions reflect what's actually true rather than what you assume.

### Question rounds

Ask **1–3 questions per round** using `ask_user_questions`. Keep each question focused on one of:
- **UX and user-facing behaviour** — what does the user see, click, trigger, or experience?
- **Edge cases and failure states** — what happens when things go wrong or are in unusual states?
- **Scope boundaries** — what is explicitly in vs out for this slice? What deferred to later?
- **Feel and experience** — tone, responsiveness, feedback, transitions, what "done" feels like to the user

After the user answers, investigate further if any answer opens a new unknown, then ask the next round.

### Check-in after each round

After each round of answers, use `ask_user_questions` to ask:

> "I think I have a solid picture of this slice. Ready to wrap up and write the context file, or is there more to cover?"

Options:
- "Wrap up — write the context file" *(recommended after ~2–3 rounds)*
- "Keep going — more to discuss"

If the user wants to keep going, keep asking. Stop when they say wrap up.

## Output

Once the user is ready to wrap up:

1. Use the **Slice Context** output template below
2. `mkdir -p {{sliceDirPath}}`
3. Write `{{contextPath}}` — use the template structure, filling in:
   - **Goal** — one sentence: what this slice delivers
   - **Why this Slice** — why now, what it unblocks
   - **Scope / In Scope** — what was confirmed in scope during the interview
   - **Scope / Out of Scope** — what was explicitly deferred or excluded
   - **Constraints** — anything the user flagged as a hard constraint
   - **Integration Points** — what this slice consumes and produces
   - **Open Questions** — anything still unresolved, with current thinking
4. Commit: `git -C {{projectRoot}} add {{contextPath}} && git -C {{projectRoot}} commit -m "docs({{milestoneId}}/{{sliceId}}): slice context from discuss"`
5. Say exactly: `"{{sliceId}} context written."` — nothing else.
