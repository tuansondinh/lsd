## What LSD is

LSD is a general-purpose coding agent that lives in your terminal. It combines:

- **Interactive TUI** with an embedded terminal — both you and the agent can interact with CLI programs, so the agent never gets blocked by interactive commands
- **Multi-provider LLM support** — Claude, GPT, Gemini, Mistral, Bedrock, Vertex AI, and more
- **Persistent memory** — remembers your preferences and project context across sessions
- **Browser automation** — full Playwright integration for web testing and scraping
- **Code intelligence** — LSP-based navigation (go-to-definition, references, rename) in typed codebases
- **Auto mode** — classifier-based autonomous execution for low-risk operations
- **Remote questions** — relay prompts to Telegram, Discord, or Slack so you can respond from your phone
- **Background subagents** — delegate tasks to isolated workers (scout, reviewer, planner)
- **Worktrees** — isolated git branches for parallel workstreams
- **Sessions** — resumable conversation history per project directory
- **Voice input** — speak your prompts (macOS native, Linux via Groq)
- **Usage tracking** — token consumption and cost reporting
- **~25 bundled extensions** — memory, browser-tools, subagent, codex-rotate, search, and more
- **Sandbox isolation** — restrict filesystem writes to the project directory

**Package:** `lsd-pi` · **Binary:** `lsd` · **Project config:** `.lsd/` · **User config:** `~/.lsd/`

### Fork lineage

LSD is a fork of **GSD 2** with the GSD-specific project workflow layer stripped out. The agent shell, tools, TUI, browser automation, sessions, worktrees, and integrations remain core.

---

## Install

### Requirements

- Node.js **>= 22** (Node 24 LTS recommended)
- Git
- macOS, Linux, or Windows

### Global install

```bash
npm install -g lsd-pi
```

If `lsd` is not found after install, check your npm global bin path:

```bash
npm prefix -g
```

Then ensure `$(npm prefix -g)/bin` is on your `PATH`.

### Local development build

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

---

## Quick start

```bash
lsd                          # start interactive session
lsd -c                       # resume last session
lsd --print "summarize repo" # one-shot mode
lsd -w                       # start in an isolated git worktree
lsd config                   # re-run setup wizard
```

---

## First launch

On first run, LSD opens an interactive setup wizard for:

- LLM provider login or API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, GitHub Copilot, and others)
- Web search provider (Brave, Tavily, built-in)
- Remote questions channel (Telegram, Discord, Slack)
- Tool API keys (Context7, Jina, Groq for voice)

Re-run setup any time:

```bash
lsd config
```

---

## Permission modes

LSD supports different permission modes controlling how aggressively it acts in your environment:

| Mode | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| **interactive** (default) | Asks for approval before write/edit/shell operations |
| **auto** | Uses a classifier model to approve low-risk tool calls automatically; still asks for high-risk ones |
| **bypass** | Runs without asking (used internally by headless/subagent workers) |

Switch modes with `/permission` inside a session or pass flags to headless commands.

---

## Sandbox

LSD supports filesystem sandboxing:

```bash
lsd --sandbox workspace-write   # restrict writes to the current directory tree
lsd --sandbox none               # no sandbox (default)
lsd --no-sandbox                 # explicit no-sandbox
```

`workspace-write` prevents the agent from writing outside the project directory.

---

## Context files (lsd.md / CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md)

LSD automatically loads project instructions from these files (in order of preference):

- `lsd.md` — LSD-native project instructions
- `CLAUDE.md` — Claude Code-compatible instructions
- `AGENTS.md` — Codex-compatible instructions

Place one of these files at the project root (or in `.lsd/`) to give the agent persistent per-project context, coding conventions, and rules.

The `--bare` flag suppresses all of these (useful for CI):

```bash
lsd headless --bare auto
```

---

## Interactive TUI
LSD comes with an embedded interactive terminal inspired by the gemini cli
- user interaction with that terminal directly from the TUI
- agent interaction with terminal programs and commands that require prompts, input, or other interactive flows without getting blocked

![Interactive TUI Terminal](./docs/images/interactive-tui-terminal.png)

---

## Persistent memory

LSD includes a built-in **persistent memory** extension.

- Stores durable facts under `~/.lsd/projects/<project>/memory/`
- Injects `MEMORY.md` into future sessions for the same project
- Runs an **auto-extract** pass on session shutdown (detached worker, uses `budgetSubagentModel` if configured)

Debug files written to the project memory directory:

- `.last-auto-extract.txt` — latest status (`saved_memory`, `nothing_worth_saving`, etc.)
- `.last-auto-extract.log` — extractor stdout/stderr

---

## Codex multi-account rotation

LSD bundles a Codex OAuth rotation extension for managing multiple ChatGPT/Codex accounts.

- Round-robin credential selection across accounts
- Background token refresh every 10 minutes
- Automatic quota/rate-limit detection and per-account backoff
- Import from `~/.codex/auth.json` or Cockpit Tools

See `/codex` commands above. Stored in `~/.lsd/agent/codex-accounts.json`.

---

## Voice input

LSD supports voice input via microphone:

- **macOS** — uses a compiled Swift speech recognizer (built automatically on first use via `swiftc`)
- **Linux** — uses a Python speech recognizer (requires `GROQ_API_KEY` and `python3` with `sounddevice`)

Toggle with `/voice` or the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+V`.

---

## Usage tracking

Track token consumption and cost across sessions:

```bash
/usage              # today, grouped by model
/usage 7d           # last 7 days
/usage 2024-03-01   # specific date
/usage today --by project-model   # by project + model
/usage --all-projects             # across all projects
/usage --json                     # machine-readable output
```

---

## Telegram integration

LSD can relay permission prompts and questions to a Telegram chat while running autonomously. Reply from your phone and LSD continues.

### Step 1 — create a Telegram bot

1. Open Telegram and search for **@BotFather**
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
3. Copy the **bot token** (looks like `123456789:ABCdefGHI...`)

### Step 2 — get your chat ID

**Easiest:** forward any message to **@userinfobot** — it replies with your chat ID.

**Alternative:** open `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/getUpdates` after sending your bot a message — look for `"chat":{"id":...}` in the response.

Group chat IDs are negative numbers starting with `-100` (e.g. `-1001234567890`).

### Step 3 — connect

```bash
/lsd remote telegram
```

LSD prompts for your bot token and chat ID, validates both, and sends a test message.

You can also connect during initial setup with `lsd config`.

### Step 4 — verify

```bash
/lsd remote status
```

### Disconnect

```bash
/lsd remote disconnect
```

### PREFERENCES.md reference

```yaml
remote_questions:
  channel: telegram
  channel_id: "-1001234567890"
  timeout_minutes: 5        # 1–30, how long LSD waits for a reply
  poll_interval_seconds: 5  # 2–30, how often LSD polls
```

Stored in `~/.lsd/PREFERENCES.md`. Project-level overrides go in `.lsd/PREFERENCES.md`.

---

## Discord & Slack integration

Same flow as Telegram — run `/lsd remote discord` or `/lsd remote slack`. Both support:

- bot token validation
- channel auto-discovery (Discord lists your servers and channels; Slack lists channels)
- manual channel ID entry as fallback
- test message on connect

---

## MCP integrations

LSD discovers and connects to MCP servers configured in:

- `.mcp.json`
- `.lsd/mcp.json`

Use `/configs` inside a session to scan for MCP servers from other AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) and import them.

### Adding MCP servers to LSD config

LSD supports two transport types: **stdio** (launch a local process) and **HTTP** (connect to a running server).

#### Stdio server (local process)

Add to `.mcp.json` or `.lsd/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/executable",
      "args": ["arg1", "arg2"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "your-key",
        "DEBUG": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If the server is installed as an npm package:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@my-org/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### HTTP server (remote connection)

For MCP servers already running on a network endpoint:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "remote-server": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${MCP_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Environment variables in `headers` and `env` are resolved at startup (use `${VAR_NAME}` syntax).

#### File placement

- **`.mcp.json`** — repo-shared configuration (commit to git)
- **`.lsd/mcp.json`** — local-only configuration (git-ignored, not shared)

If both files exist, server names are merged and the first definition found wins.

#### Managing MCP servers

Use the `/mcp` slash command inside a session:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/mcp list` | List all configured servers and their status |
| `/mcp inspect <server>` | Connect and show available tools for a server |
| `/mcp enable <server>` | Enable a server |
| `/mcp disable <server>` | Disable a server |
| `/mcp reload` | Reload config and reconnect enabled servers |

MCP servers connect lazily — `/mcp inspect` or the first tool call triggers the connection.

---

## Sessions

LSD stores per-project sessions and can resume prior work.

```bash
lsd sessions     # browse and pick a session to resume
lsd -c           # resume the most recent session automatically
```

---

## Worktrees

LSD supports isolated git worktrees for parallel streams of work:

```bash
lsd -w                        # auto-named worktree
lsd -w my-feature             # named worktree
lsd worktree list             # list with status
lsd worktree merge my-feature # squash-merge into main
lsd worktree clean            # remove merged/empty worktrees
lsd worktree remove NAME      # remove specific worktree
```

Lifecycle:
1. `lsd -w` — creates worktree, starts session inside it
2. Work normally — all changes stay on the worktree branch
3. Exit — dirty work is auto-committed
4. `lsd -w` — resume where you left off
5. `lsd worktree merge` — squash-merge into main when done

---

## Headless mode

Run LSD without the TUI for CI, scripts, or automation:

```bash
lsd headless                                    # run auto mode
lsd headless next                               # run one unit
lsd headless status                             # show queue status
lsd headless --json auto                        # JSONL event stream
lsd headless --output-format json auto          # structured JSON result
lsd headless --timeout 60000 auto              # with 1-minute timeout
lsd headless --bare auto                        # skip lsd.md/CLAUDE.md/settings
lsd headless --resume abc123 auto              # resume a prior session
lsd headless --supervised auto                 # orchestrator mode
lsd headless --answers answers.json auto       # pre-supply answers/secrets
lsd headless new-milestone --context spec.md   # create milestone from file
lsd headless new-milestone --context spec.md --auto  # create + execute
```

Exit codes: `0` success, `1` error/timeout, `10` blocked, `11` cancelled.

---

## Browser automation

LSD includes full browser automation via Playwright:

- local app verification and screenshots
- form filling and interaction
- DOM inspection and accessibility tree
- assertions and debug bundles
- network request inspection
- device emulation

---

## LSP code intelligence

LSD includes a first-class `lsp` tool for semantic code navigation in typed codebases.

Use it for:

- go-to-definition
- find references and implementations
- hover/type info
- workspace and file symbols
- incoming/outgoing calls
- diagnostics and quick fixes
- formatting and safe rename operations

### Why LSP is good

Unlike raw text search, LSP understands symbols, types, scopes, and project structure. That means the agent can:

- jump to the right definition instead of matching the wrong string
- find real references across the codebase
- inspect function signatures and docs without reading huge files
- catch type errors immediately after edits
- apply safer refactors like rename and format

In practice this makes the agent faster, more accurate, and less likely to break typed projects during navigation or refactors.

### Typical LSP usage

```text
lsp definition      # jump to a symbol definition
lsp references      # find where a symbol is used
lsp hover           # inspect type/docs at a position
lsp diagnostics     # check errors in a file or workspace
lsp rename          # perform a semantic rename
lsp format          # format a file with the language server
lsp status          # show installed/active language servers
```

### In LSD sessions

LSD prefers `lsp` over grep/find for typed codebases when a language server is available.

If a server is missing, run:

```bash
/setup
```

or inspect status with:

```text
lsp status
```

---

## RTK shell compression

LSD supports **RTK** for shell-command compression.

RTK rewrites certain shell commands into a more compact representation before they run, which helps reduce repetitive terminal output in agent context.

### Why RTK is good

RTK is useful when the agent or a background shell runs lots of repetitive commands like:

- `git status`
- `git diff`
- test runs
- package-manager commands
- other high-noise shell commands

Benefits:

- saves context tokens
- reduces noisy terminal output
- keeps long sessions cleaner
- lets the agent spend more context on code and reasoning instead of duplicated shell text

When active, LSD can also surface session savings like how many tokens RTK saved.

### Enable RTK

Turn it on in `/settings` by enabling **RTK**.

You can also enable it in preferences:

```yaml
experimental:
  rtk: true
```

RTK requires a restart after toggling.

### Where RTK helps most

RTK is most valuable in long-running sessions, background shell workflows, and repos where the agent repeatedly checks git state, runs tests, or invokes build tooling.

---

## Web research

- Google-backed search (`google_search`)
- Brave / Tavily web search
- Page extraction via Jina
- Context7 library docs lookup (`/context7`)

---

## Extensions, themes, and skills

LSD supports a package-like extension system:

```bash
lsd install <source>   # install extension/theme/skill
lsd remove <source>    # remove
lsd list               # list installed packages
```

Sources: `npm:@scope/pkg`, `git:github.com/user/repo`, `https://...`, local paths.

Bundled extensions include: memory, remote-questions, browser-tools, subagent, codex-rotate, usage, voice, bg-shell, async-jobs, context7, universal-config, search-the-web, cache-timer, mac-tools, aws-auth.

## Naming note

LSD evolved from GSD 2, but the product, docs, and recommended workflows are LSD-first. Prefer:

- `lsd` — binary
- `.lsd/` — project state
- `~/.lsd/` — global state
- `/lsd remote` — remote questions
- `/help` — live in-session command reference

Any remaining `/gsd` surfaces should be treated as compatibility aliases, not the primary workflow.
